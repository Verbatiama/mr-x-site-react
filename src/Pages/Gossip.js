        <p>So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Checkmate... Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.</p>
        <p>This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.</p>
